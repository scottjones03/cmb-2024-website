    // "Tequila cocktail brand Pimentae was launched in March 2021 by female founders Alice & Wynter. Mexico opened their eyes to the incredibly complex and sophisticated nature of high-quality tequila. Not something to be shot, something to be sipped and savoured.  ",
    // "They quickly realised there was a huge knowledge gap in the UK driven by the shot culture and poor-quality options available on the shelves. Pimentae was born to shift these perceptions and introduce bar quality cocktails in multiple formats that broaden the footprint of how & where tequila is enjoyed.  ",
    // "Their multi-award-winning range includes a Spicy Margarita, Tommyâ€™s Margarita and Cucumber Margarita that can simply be poured over ice and enjoyed in your own pocket of paradise."
